# PML Freight Tech Developer Evaluation
This repository is used to evaluate core skills of prospective Node JS developers at PML Freight Tech.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
1. Install dependencies with Yarn or NPM.
1. There are a variety of scripts defined in package.json to help you.
1. Complete the empty method definitions in ./src/index.ts so that the tests defined in ./src/index.spec.ts pass
1. Begin at the easier methods at the top of the file and work your way down to the more challenging ones.
1. It is not mandatory that your script pass all tests, do your best and have fun.
1. Once complete, build the typescript project and create a zip file of the project directory and email to [dan@pmlfreight.tech](mailto:dan@pmlfreight.tech)

Please don't submit your answers via a pull request. That's not how this works :P.

Feel free to ask questions if you require clarifications.
